      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing a new era of 1:10 scaled autonomous racing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to unveil the open-sourcing of the award-winning ForzaETH Race Stack. Showcased across numerous international F1TENTH races and securing 1st place at ICRA23, the ForzaETH Race Stack elevates the state-of-the-art, enabling new possibilities in scaled head-to-head autonomous racing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the open-sourcing, a paper titled &amp;ldquo;ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware&amp;rdquo; is available on arxiv, detailing the system&amp;rsquo;s architecture, algorithms, and performance benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Localization Techniques for Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;synpf-paper&#34;&gt;SynPF Paper&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This work introduces SynPF, an MCL-based algorithm tailored for high-speed racing environments. Benchmarked against Cartographer, a state-of-the-art pose-graph SLAM algorithm, SynPF leverages synergies from previous particle-filtering methods and synthesizes them for the high-performance racing domain. Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip—a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour. Conversely, SynPF demonstrates robustness in these challenging conditions and a low-latency computation time of 1.25 ms on on-board computers without a GPU. Using the F1TENTH platform, a 1:10&#xA;scaled autonomous racing vehicle, this work not only highlights the vulnerabilities of existing algorithms in high-speed scenarios, tested up until 7.6 m s−1, but also emphasizes the potential of SynPF as a viable  alternative, especially in deteriorating odometry conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness of LiDAR, Radar and Depth Cameras Against Ill-Reflecting Surfaces in Autonomous Vehicles: An Experimental Study</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Range-measuring sensors play a critical role in autonomous driving systems. While LiDAR technology has been dominant, its vulnerability to adverse weather conditions is well-documented. This paper focuses on secondary adverse conditions and the implications of ill-reflective surfaces on range measurement sensors. We assess the influence of this condition on the three primary ranging modalities used in autonomous mobile robotics: LiDAR, RADAR, and Depth-Camera. Based on accurate experimental evaluation the papers findings reveal that under ill-reflectivity, LiDAR ranging performance drops significantly to 33% of its nominal operating conditions, whereas RADAR and Depth-Cameras maintain up to 100% of their nominal distance ranging capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate on a 1:10 scaled autonomous racecar how ill-reflectivity adversely impacts downstream robotics tasks, highlighting the necessity for robust range sensing in autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit (MAP) Controller for High-Performance Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://forzaeth.ch/blog/map_paper/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;map-paper&#34;&gt;MAP Paper&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A big reason for the teams outstanding performance at the F1TENTH Grand Prix is our Path tracking controller. Developed by thesis students for our first Race at ICRA 2022, the Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit controller allows us to track our racing line at speeds close to the limit of friction. The paper was published and presented at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2023 in London.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous racing is a research field gaining large popularity, as it pushes autonomous driving algorithms to their limits and serves as a catalyst for general autonomous driving. For scaled autonomous racing platforms, the computational constraint and complexity often limit the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC). As a consequence, geometric controllers are the most frequently deployed controllers. They prove to be performant while yielding implementation and operational simplicity. Yet, they inherently lack the incorporation of model dynamics, thus limiting the race car to a velocity domain where tire slip can be neglected. This paper presents Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit (MAP) a high-performance model-based trajectory tracking algorithm that preserves the simplicity of geometric approaches while leveraging tire dynamics. The proposed algorithm allows accurate tracking of a trajectory at unprecedented velocities compared to State-of-the-Art (SotA) geometric controllers. The MAP controller is experimentally validated and outperforms the reference geometric controller four-fold in terms of lateral tracking error, yielding a tracking error of 0.055m at tested speeds up to 11m/s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TC-Driver: A Trajectory Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Approach to Zero-Shot Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tc-driver&#34;&gt;TC-Driver&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Autonomous racing is becoming popular for academic and industry researchers as a test&#xA;for general autonomous driving by pushing perception, planning, and control algorithms to their&#xA;limits. While traditional control methods such as model predictive control are capable of generating&#xA;an optimal control sequence at the edge of the vehicles’ physical controllability, these methods are&#xA;sensitive to the accuracy of the modeling parameters, such as tire modeling coefficients. As model&#xA;mismatch is inevitable in reality, the heuristic nature of Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a viable&#xA;approach to modeling robustness. This paper presents TC-Driver, an RL approach for robust control&#xA;in autonomous racing. In particular, the TC-Driver agent is conditioned by a trajectory generated&#xA;by any arbitrary traditional high-level trajectory planner. The proposed TC-Driver architecture&#xA;addresses the tire parameter modeling inaccuracies by exploiting the learning capabilities of RL while&#xA;utilizing the reliability of traditional planning methods in a hybrid fashion. We train the agent under&#xA;varying tire conditions, allowing it to generalize to different model parameters, aiming to increase&#xA;the racing capabilities of the system in practice. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed&#xA;hybrid RL architecture of the TC-Driver improves the generalization robustness of autonomous&#xA;racing agents when compared to a previous state-of-the-art end-to-end-based architecture. Namely,&#xA;the proposed controller yields a 29-fold improvement in crash ratio when facing model mismatch&#xA;and can zero-shot transfer its behavior on unseen tracks which present completely new features,&#xA;while the end-to-end baseline fails. When deployed on a physical system, the proposed architecture&#xA;demonstrates zero-shot Sim2Real capabilities that outperform end-to-end agents 10-fold in terms&#xA;of crash ratio while exhibiting similar driving characteristics in reality as in simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
