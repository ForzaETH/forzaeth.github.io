      <description>A team comprised of five master students secured a prestigious second place in the Indy autonomous race simulation at the tech event CES in Las Vegas. This marked a first step in extending the ForzaETH Race Stack to full-scale autonomous racing. ForzaETH’s team was only surpassed by the experienced PoliMOVE Autonomous Racing Team from Politecnico di Milano. An exceptional and very promising achievement for the future.&#xA;Article on the ETH D-ITET Website</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Localization Techniques for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/synpf_paper/</link>

      <description>SynPF Paper Abstract This work introduces SynPF, an MCL-based algorithm tailored for high-speed racing environments. Benchmarked against Cartographer, a state-of-the-art pose-graph SLAM algorithm, SynPF leverages synergies from previous particle-filtering methods and synthesizes them for the high-performance racing domain. Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip—a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness of LiDAR, Radar and Depth Cameras Against Ill-Reflecting Surfaces in Autonomous Vehicles: An Experimental Study</title>

      <description>Abstract Range-measuring sensors play a critical role in autonomous driving systems. While LiDAR technology has been dominant, its vulnerability to adverse weather conditions is well-documented. This paper focuses on secondary adverse conditions and the implications of ill-reflective surfaces on range measurement sensors. We assess the influence of this condition on the three primary ranging modalities used in autonomous mobile robotics: LiDAR, RADAR, and Depth-Camera. Based on accurate experimental evaluation the papers findings reveal that under ill-reflectivity, LiDAR ranging performance drops significantly to 33% of its nominal operating conditions, whereas RADAR and Depth-Cameras maintain up to 100% of their nominal distance ranging capabilities.</description>

      <description>A dedicated team of six students devoted their efforts to enhancing the autonomous racing stack through their bachelor, semester, and master theses. Their research led to significant improvements in the localization, obstacle detection, and control aspects of our autonomous racing cars.&#xA;Following a semester filled with rigorous work and preparation, we eagerly entered the F1TENTH Grand Prix at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, where 22 teams from around the world vied for the prestigious title.</description>

      <title>Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit (MAP) Controller for High-Performance Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/map_paper/</link>

      <description>MAP Paper A big reason for the teams outstanding performance at the F1TENTH Grand Prix is our Path tracking controller. Developed by thesis students for our first Race at ICRA 2022, the Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit controller allows us to track our racing line at speeds close to the limit of friction. The paper was published and presented at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2023 in London.&#xA;Abstract Autonomous racing is a research field gaining large popularity, as it pushes autonomous driving algorithms to their limits and serves as a catalyst for general autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>TC-Driver: A Trajectory Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Approach to Zero-Shot Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>TC-Driver Abstract Autonomous racing is becoming popular for academic and industry researchers as a test for general autonomous driving by pushing perception, planning, and control algorithms to their limits. While traditional control methods such as model predictive control are capable of generating an optimal control sequence at the edge of the vehicles’ physical controllability, these methods are sensitive to the accuracy of the modeling parameters, such as tire modeling coefficients. As model mismatch is inevitable in reality, the heuristic nature of Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a viable approach to modeling robustness.</description>

      <description>On August 20 and 21, 2022, the ForzaETH team participated in its second race at the F1TENTH Grand Prix held at the Lausitzring Eurospeedway racetrack. Nine teams were in contention for victory during this tournament.&#xA;During the initial day of the competition, the team demonstrated exceptional performance by securing the top position in the qualifying phase. They achieved this feat by completing the most consecutive laps in five minutes and recording the fastest lap time.</description>

      <description>A group of students, consisting of three undergraduates and one master&amp;rsquo;s student, formed the inaugural Race Team. Together, they dedicated themselves to creating advanced path planning algorithms, obstacle detection systems, and velocity and path tracking controllers. Following a semester of relentless effort, the team entered its first competition — the F1TENTH Grand Prix held at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Philadelphia. The event attracted 20 teams from around the globe, all fighting for the win.</description>
