This week, ForzaETH secured 3rd place at the Roboracer Competition at ICRA25 in Atlanta USA!

The racetrack was long and narrow, combining high-speed straights with technical sections featuring tight corners and slalom sequences. The medium-grip surface with discontinuities made it even more challenging. The team had to work hard to find the right balance between speed and reliability, pushing the car to its limits.

After qualifying in P6 with a tough time trial session, we fought our way up the race bracket, facing five teams. We competed in the semifinal of the double elimination bracket and the final of the losers bracket.
