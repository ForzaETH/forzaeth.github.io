A group of students, consisting of three undergraduates and one master's student, formed the inaugural Race Team. Together, they dedicated themselves to creating advanced path planning algorithms, obstacle detection systems, and velocity and path tracking controllers. Following a semester of relentless effort, the team entered its first competition â€” the F1TENTH Grand Prix held at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Philadelphia. The event attracted 20 teams from around the globe, all fighting for the win. Against stiff competition, the ForzaETH team delivered an outstanding performance, securing an impressive 4th place finish and with that performing the best out of all the newbie teams. This success motivates further develop our racing algorithms and go for the win at the next F1TENTH Race.
