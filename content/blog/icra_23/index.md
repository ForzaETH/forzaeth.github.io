A dedicated team of six students devoted their efforts to enhancing the autonomous racing stack through their bachelor, semester, and master theses. Their research led to significant improvements in the localization, obstacle detection, and control aspects of our autonomous racing cars.

Following a semester filled with rigorous work and preparation, we eagerly entered the F1TENTH Grand Prix at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, where 22 teams from around the world vied for the prestigious title.

Our team showcased exceptional performance on the first day during the time-trials phase, securing the pole position for the ensuing head-to-head races. The head-to-head competition featured a knockout format, with two racecars on the track, aiming to win in a best-of-three race against the opposing team for advancement to the next round. Without a single loss, we progressed to the final, delivering an outstanding performance that ultimately led to our victory. This achievement stands as our most significant to date, solidifying our position among the top F1TENTH teams globally.
