We wrapped up 2024 with an exciting race at the The Roboracer Foundation 22nd F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix at CDC24 in Milano.

Our primary objective was to test our reinforcement learning (RL) controller, which presented unique challenges. The track's rapidly changing grip conditions, caused by dust accumulation, complicated our policy training. Adapting to the intricate tire-floor dynamics proved difficult, making it challenging to outperform our existing MAP controller.

The competition wasn't without its dramatic moments. A collision with another car resulted in significant hardware damage, breaking the servo and damaging the driveshaft. However, our team's resilience shined through as we performed an intensive overnight repair, bringing the car back to racing condition.

Despite starting the following day with a minimally tuned vehicle, we demonstrated remarkable adaptability. In a hard-fought final against UniBo Motorsport, we narrowly missed the podium, ultimately securing a respectable fourth place.

These experiences have only fueled our excitement for future challenges. We're looking forward to returning to the track at ICRA2025, continuing to push the boundaries of autonomous racing. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to the competition organizers for hosting such an incredible event.
