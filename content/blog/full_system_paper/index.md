Introducing a new era of 1:10 scaled autonomous racing:

We are thrilled to unveil the open-sourcing of the award-winning ForzaETH Race Stack. Showcased across numerous international roboracer races and securing 1st place at ICRA23, the ForzaETH Race Stack elevates the state-of-the-art, enabling new possibilities in scaled head-to-head autonomous racing.

Accompanying the open-sourcing, a paper titled "ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware" is available on arxiv, detailing the system's architecture, algorithms, and performance benchmarks.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to Center for Project-Based Learning (PBL) and ETH Zurich. Their support and collaboration have been pivotal in our journey.

Stay tuned for more contributions as we continue to explore the limits of autonomous racing. Exciting developments, including the ROS2 version of the ForzaETH Race Stack, are on the horizon.
