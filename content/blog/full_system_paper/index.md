We're thrilled to share that after over half a year of dedicated effort, our preprint titled <em> "ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware" </em> is now available. This comprehensive system paper offers an in-depth look at the Race Stack that propelled us to victory at the ICRA 2022 F1TENTH Grand Prix. Furthermore, we're excited to announce that we are releasing the complete race stack as open source. The race stack is fully based on ROS 1 and mainly written in Python. Stay tuned for a ROS 2 version.

Our goal is to advance the F1TENTH community by contributing to the pool of resources available, thereby encouraging further innovation in the exciting field of autonomous racing.
